                Hypertext Markup Language is the standard text markup
                language used to create web pages. The last version of the
                language is HTML5. HTML cannot be defined as a programming language.
                Because a program that works on its own with HTML code can not be written.

                JavaScript® (usually abbreviated as js) is an object-oriented programming
                language that is simply interpreted and blended with first-class functions.
                It is commonly known as a scripting language for web pages, but is often
                used in non-browser environments such as node.js or Apache CouchDB. Having
                a prototype-based and multi-paradigm language provides a dynamic and
                functional structure. Learn more about JavaScript.
